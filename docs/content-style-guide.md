# StrainMatch Content Style Guide

## Overview
This guide ensures consistent, professional, and accessible content across the StrainMatch cannabis recommendation platform.

## General Principles

### Voice & Tone
- **Professional yet approachable**: Cannabis is a legitimate industry; maintain professionalism while being welcoming
- **Educational and informative**: Focus on helping users make informed decisions
- **Respectful of medical users**: Cannabis serves both recreational and medical purposes
- **Compliance-focused**: Always include necessary legal disclaimers and age restrictions

### Accessibility
- Use clear, simple language
- Avoid jargon when possible; explain when necessary
- Use active voice
- Keep sentences concise

## Capitalization Rules

### Headings and Titles
- **Page titles**: Title Case (e.g., "Explore Cannabis Strains")
- **Section headings**: Title Case (e.g., "Desired Effects")
- **Card titles**: Title Case (e.g., "Blue Dream")
- **Button text**: Title Case for primary actions, sentence case for secondary

### Labels and Form Elements
- **Field labels**: Title Case (e.g., "Date of Birth")
- **Input placeholders**: Sentence case (e.g., "Search strains, effects, or flavors...")
- **Helper text**: Sentence case
- **Error messages**: Sentence case

### Cannabis-Specific Terms
- **Strain names**: Proper capitalization as registered (e.g., "Blue Dream", "Northern Lights")
- **Strain types**: Lowercase (e.g., "indica", "sativa", "hybrid")
- **Effects**: Lowercase (e.g., "relaxed", "euphoric", "focused")
- **Flavors**: Lowercase (e.g., "citrus", "earthy", "sweet")
- **Medical conditions**: Title Case for proper nouns (e.g., "ADHD", "PTSD"), lowercase for common terms (e.g., "anxiety", "chronic pain")

## Punctuation Guidelines

### Periods
- **Always use periods**: In complete sentences, error messages, descriptions
- **Never use periods**: In headings, button text, labels, list items (unless multiple sentences)

### Commas
- **Oxford comma**: Always use (e.g., "strains, edibles, and concentrates")
- **Lists**: Use commas to separate items in effects, flavors, and other lists

### Apostrophes
- **Contractions**: Use sparingly in formal text, freely in casual descriptions
- **Possessives**: Standard rules apply

### Quotation Marks
- **Strain names**: No quotes needed for strain names
- **User input examples**: Use quotes for placeholder examples
